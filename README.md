# CS-320-Portfolio-Item
This was an assignment for my CS-320 Software Test Automation & QA Class.

I was required to answer these questions:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing often and testing first. Following the rubric for all questions and doing a lot of research.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Research, research, and research! I am always a proponent of using Stack Overflow and Google for help.

How do I approach designing software?
If I need to design something visually, my first idae is to write with pen and paper. For everything else I've always been a fan of using notes to write down all my ideas prior to typing any code.
